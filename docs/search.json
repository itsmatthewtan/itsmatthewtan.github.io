The assignment required us to: - Identify a real-world dataset - Perform exploratory data analysis - Create meaningful visualizations - Present actionable insights\nChallenges I Faced:\n\nData Cleaning: The raw trading data had inconsistencies in timestamps and missing values (~5% of records). I used Python pandas to handle missing data through forward-fill for time-series continuity.\nChoosing the Right Visualization: Initially, I tried cramming everything into a single chart, which looked cluttered. After feedback from my professor, I redesigned it as a multi-panel dashboard.\nColor Accessibility: My first version used red-green colors, which I learned could be problematic for colorblind viewers. I switched to a blue-orange palette for better accessibility.\nPerformance: Rendering 50,000+ data points caused performance issues. I learned to aggregate data by hour instead of plotting every transaction.\n\nWhat I Learned:\n\nThe importance of data cleaning before visualization\nHow to choose chart types that match the data story\nThe power of multi-panel visualizations for complex datasets\nAccessibility considerations in data visualization design\nHow to use Python libraries effectively for data analysis\n\n\n\n\nTools Used: - Python 3.9: Main programming language - pandas: Data manipulation and aggregation - matplotlib & seaborn: Visualization libraries - numpy: Statistical calculations - Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment\nCode Snippet: ```python"

    "text": "During my Data Analytics module in Year 1, I conducted an analysis of cryptocurrency trading patterns among Singapore investors. This project aimed to identify trends in trading behavior, popular cryptocurrencies, and correlations between market volatility and trading volume.\n\n\n\nDataset Details: - Source: Simulated trading data based on public cryptocurrency APIs (CoinGecko, Binance) - Variables: Trading volume, cryptocurrency type, time of day, price volatility, trader demographics - Time Period: January 2023 - December 2024 (24 months) - Size: 50,000+ transaction records from 1,200 simulated traders - Metrics: BTC, ETH, SOL, MATIC trading volumes, hourly price changes, trader age groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency Trading Patterns\n\n\nNote: This is a multi-panel visualization showing: - Top Left: Trading volume by hour of day (shows peak activity at 9-10 PM SGT) - Top Right: Most traded cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin dominates at 45%, followed by Ethereum at 30%) - Bottom Left: Correlation heatmap between volatility and trading volume - Bottom Right: Age group distribution of active traders\n\n\n\nKey Insights:\n\nPeak Trading Hours: Singapore crypto traders are most active between 9-11 PM, coinciding with evening relaxation time after work\nCryptocurrency Preferences:\n\nBitcoin: 45% of trading volume\nEthereum: 30% of trading volume\nSolana: 15% of trading volume\nOther altcoins: 10% of trading volume\n\nVolatility Correlation: Strong positive correlation (r = 0.78) between price volatility and trading volume - traders are more active during volatile market conditions\nDemographic Patterns:\n\nHighest activity in 25-34 age group (40%)\nSecond highest in 35-44 age group (30%)\nYounger traders (18-24) show preference for smaller-cap altcoins\n\nWeekend Effect: Trading volume increases by 35% on weekends compared to weekdays\n\n\n\n\nWhy I chose this visualization type:\nI used a dashboard-style multi-panel layout because: - It allows comparison of multiple related metrics simultaneously - Each panel tells a part of the overall story - Viewers can identify patterns across different dimensions of the data\nSpecific chart types: - Line chart for hourly trends: Best shows temporal patterns and peak hours - Pie chart for cryptocurrency distribution: Clearly shows proportional market share - Heatmap for correlations: Reveals relationships between variables at a glance - Stacked bar chart for demographics: Shows both total volume and age distribution\nColor scheme: - Blue gradient: Represents trust and stability (appropriate for financial data) - Orange/Red: Used for high volatility and peak activity (draws attention) - Green: Positive price movements and growth metrics - Consistent color palette across all panels for professional appearance\nLayout and formatting: - Clear axis labels with appropriate units (%, SGD, hours) - Legend placed consistently in top-right of each panel - Grid lines for easy value reading - Annotations highlighting key insights\n\n\n\nContext:\nThis project was completed for my DAT1001: Introduction to Data Analytics module during Semester 1, Year 1. The assignment required us to: - Identify a real-world dataset - Perform exploratory data analysis - Create meaningful visualizations - Present actionable insights\nChallenges I Faced:\n\nData Cleaning: The raw trading data had inconsistencies in timestamps and missing values (~5% of records). I used Python pandas to handle missing data through forward-fill for time-series continuity.\nChoosing the Right Visualization: Initially, I tried cramming everything into a single chart, which looked cluttered. After feedback from my professor, I redesigned it as a multi-panel dashboard.\nColor Accessibility: My first version used red-green colors, which I learned could be problematic for colorblind viewers. I switched to a blue-orange palette for better accessibility.\nPerformance: Rendering 50,000+ data points caused performance issues. I learned to aggregate data by hour instead of plotting every transaction.\n\nWhat I Learned:\n\nThe importance of data cleaning before visualization\nHow to choose chart types that match the data story\nThe power of multi-panel visualizations for complex datasets\nAccessibility considerations in data visualization design\nHow to use Python libraries effectively for data analysis\n\n\n\n\nTools Used: - Python 3.9: Main programming language - pandas: Data manipulation and aggregation - matplotlib & seaborn: Visualization libraries - numpy: Statistical calculations - Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment\nCode Snippet: ```python"
