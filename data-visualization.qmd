## Singapore Cryptocurrency Trading Patterns Analysis (2023-2024)

### Overview

During my Data Analytics module in Year 1, I conducted an analysis of cryptocurrency trading patterns among Singapore investors. This project aimed to identify trends in trading behavior, popular cryptocurrencies, and correlations between market volatility and trading volume.

### The Data

**Dataset Details:**
- **Source**: Simulated trading data based on public cryptocurrency APIs (CoinGecko, Binance)
- **Variables**: Trading volume, cryptocurrency type, time of day, price volatility, trader demographics
- **Time Period**: January 2023 - December 2024 (24 months)
- **Size**: 50,000+ transaction records from 1,200 simulated traders
- **Metrics**: BTC, ETH, SOL, MATIC trading volumes, hourly price changes, trader age groups

### Visualization

*Note: This is a multi-panel visualization showing:*
- **Top Left**: Trading volume by hour of day (shows peak activity at 9-10 PM SGT)
- **Top Right**: Most traded cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin dominates at 45%, followed by Ethereum at 30%)
- **Bottom Left**: Correlation heatmap between volatility and trading volume
- **Bottom Right**: Age group distribution of active traders

### What This Visualizes

**Key Insights:**

1. **Peak Trading Hours**: Singapore crypto traders are most active between 9-11 PM, coinciding with evening relaxation time after work

2. **Cryptocurrency Preferences**: 
   - Bitcoin: 45% of trading volume
   - Ethereum: 30% of trading volume
   - Solana: 15% of trading volume
   - Other altcoins: 10% of trading volume

3. **Volatility Correlation**: Strong positive correlation (r = 0.78) between price volatility and trading volume - traders are more active during volatile market conditions

4. **Demographic Patterns**: 
   - Highest activity in 25-34 age group (40%)
   - Second highest in 35-44 age group (30%)
   - Younger traders (18-24) show preference for smaller-cap altcoins

5. **Weekend Effect**: Trading volume increases by 35% on weekends compared to weekdays

### Design Choices

**Why I chose this visualization type:**

I used a **dashboard-style multi-panel layout** because:
- It allows comparison of multiple related metrics simultaneously
- Each panel tells a part of the overall story
- Viewers can identify patterns across different dimensions of the data

**Specific chart types:**
- **Line chart** for hourly trends: Best shows temporal patterns and peak hours
- **Pie chart** for cryptocurrency distribution: Clearly shows proportional market share
- **Heatmap** for correlations: Reveals relationships between variables at a glance
- **Stacked bar chart** for demographics: Shows both total volume and age distribution

**Color scheme:**
- **Blue gradient**: Represents trust and stability (appropriate for financial data)
- **Orange/Red**: Used for high volatility and peak activity (draws attention)
- **Green**: Positive price movements and growth metrics
- Consistent color palette across all panels for professional appearance

**Layout and formatting:**
- Clear axis labels with appropriate units (%, SGD, hours)
- Legend placed consistently in top-right of each panel
- Grid lines for easy value reading
- Annotations highlighting key insights

### The Story Behind This

**Context:**

This project was completed for my **DAT1001: Introduction to Data Analytics** module during Semester 1, Year 1. The assignment required us to:
- Identify a real-world dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Create meaningful visualizations
- Present actionable insights

**Challenges I Faced:**

1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw trading data had inconsistencies in timestamps and missing values (~5% of records). I used Python pandas to handle missing data through forward-fill for time-series continuity.

2. **Choosing the Right Visualization**: Initially, I tried cramming everything into a single chart, which looked cluttered. After feedback from my professor, I redesigned it as a multi-panel dashboard.

3. **Color Accessibility**: My first version used red-green colors, which I learned could be problematic for colorblind viewers. I switched to a blue-orange palette for better accessibility.

4. **Performance**: Rendering 50,000+ data points caused performance issues. I learned to aggregate data by hour instead of plotting every transaction.

**What I Learned:**

- The importance of data cleaning before visualization
- How to choose chart types that match the data story
- The power of multi-panel visualizations for complex datasets
- Accessibility considerations in data visualization design
- How to use Python libraries effectively for data analysis

### Technical Details

**Tools Used:**
- **Python 3.9**: Main programming language
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and aggregation
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Visualization libraries
- **numpy**: Statistical calculations
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
